## Permission System Refactoring Plan ðŸ”§

**Priority: HIGH** - Performance and architecture cleanup required

### Overview
The codebase contains inefficient permission checking patterns that create unnecessary database queries. Currently using `$user->roleTemplates()->whereJsonContains('permissions', 'x')->exists()` instead of the efficient `$user->hasPermission('x')` methods already available in the User model.

### Current Issues
- **Performance**: Multiple identical database queries for permission checks
- **Inconsistency**: Mix of efficient and inefficient permission checking methods
- **Bloat**: Backward compatibility method that shouldn't exist
- **Architecture**: Single role template per user but code suggests multiple templates

### Affected Files Analysis
- `app/Http/Controllers/Portal/CustomerPortalController.php` (5 instances)
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/TimeEntryController.php` (20+ instances)
- `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/ManagerDashboardController.php` (3 instances)
- `app/Http/Controllers/UserInvitationController.php` (9 instances)
- `app/Http/Resources/TimeEntryResource.php` (7 instances)

### Refactoring Tasks

-   [ ] **Phase 1: Analysis & Permission Mapping**
    - Catalog all permission strings used in `whereJsonContains()` calls
    - Map them to existing User model methods where possible
    - Identify missing permission methods that need to be added to User model

-   [ ] **Phase 2: Controller Refactoring** 
    - Replace `roleTemplates()->whereJsonContains('permissions', 'admin.manage')->exists()` with `hasPermission('admin.manage')`
    - Replace `roleTemplates()->whereJsonContains('permissions', 'teams.manage')->exists()` with `hasPermission('teams.manage')`
    - Use `hasAnyPermission(['perm1', 'perm2'])` for complex permission checks
    - **Files**: CustomerPortalController, TimeEntryController, ManagerDashboardController, UserInvitationController

-   [ ] **Phase 3: Resource Refactoring**
    - Update `app/Http/Resources/TimeEntryResource.php` to use efficient permission checks
    - Move permission logic out of resources where possible

-   [ ] **Phase 4: Clean Up & Testing**
    - Remove bloated `roleTemplates()` method from User model
    - Add any missing efficient permission methods to User model
    - Performance testing to confirm query reduction
    - Verify all permission checks still work correctly

### Expected Benefits
- **Reduced Database Queries**: From N queries per permission check to 0 (using loaded relationships)
- **Better Performance**: Faster page loads and API responses
- **Improved Maintainability**: Single source of truth for permission logic
- **Consistent Architecture**: All permission checks use the same efficient pattern

## System Architecture Improvements

-   [x] **Enhanced Timer Assignment System**

    Successfully implemented flexible timer assignment system that aligns with Service Vault's ticketing platform architecture.

    **Implemented Features:**
    - âœ… Timers can be assigned to either a ticket OR an account (not both)
    - âœ… General timers with no assignment (for tracking before commitment)
    - âœ… Timer-to-time-entry commitment requires ticket or account assignment
    - âœ… Ticket assignment automatically implies ticket's account for billing
    - âœ… Account-only assignment for general administrative or overhead time

    **Technical Implementation Completed:**
    - âœ… Updated Timer model with proper account relationship and validation methods
    - âœ… Enhanced timer creation UI with three assignment options (General, Ticket, Account)
    - âœ… Added validation logic preventing time entry commitment without assignment
    - âœ… Updated API controllers with Agent-only validation and assignment handling
    - âœ… Integrated billing system to handle both ticket-based and account-based entries

-   [x] **Refine Time Entry Data Model for Agent/Customer Architecture**

    Successfully implemented proper time entry relationships that align with Service Vault's B2B platform architecture.

    **User Type Distinction Implemented:**
    - âœ… **Agents**: Internal service provider users with `user_type = 'agent'` who can create timers and time entries
    - âœ… **Account Users (Customers)**: External customer users with `user_type = 'account_user'` who submit tickets but cannot log time

    **Database Schema Updates Completed:**
    ```
    âœ… users table: Added user_type enum field (agent/account_user)
    âœ… time_entries.account_id: Made NOT NULL (always required for billing)
    âœ… Database constraints: Added ticket/account consistency validation
    âœ… Timer model: Added account relationship and billing account resolution
    ```

    **Business Logic & Validation Implemented:**
    - âœ… **Agent-Only Time Creation**: `User::canCreateTimeEntries()` validation in controllers
    - âœ… **Account Context Required**: Database constraint enforcing account_id NOT NULL
    - âœ… **Multi-Agent Support**: Multiple agents can log time on same ticket
    - âœ… **Ticket Consistency**: Automatic validation that ticket.account_id matches time_entry.account_id
    - âœ… **Permission Validation**: Agent permission checks for accessible accounts

    **API Integration Completed:**
    - âœ… Timer creation validates user is Agent before allowing timer start
    - âœ… Time entry creation validates Agent permissions and data consistency
    - âœ… Timer-to-time-entry conversion includes billing account resolution
    - âœ… Enhanced error handling for validation failures

    **Benefits Achieved:**
    - âœ… Perfect alignment with service ticket workflow architecture
    - âœ… Accurate time tracking with proper Agent/Customer separation
    - âœ… Improved reporting capabilities (time per ticket, time per account)
    - âœ… Enhanced billing accuracy with mandatory account context
