### Real-Time Messaging

Each ticket has a real-time comment system:
- **Live Updates**: Messages appear instantly via WebSocket
- **Permission-Based**: Users only see messages they're authorized to view
- **Notifications**: Email and in-app notifications for relevant updates
- **File Attachments**: Support for documents, images, etc.

### Ticket Addons

Add billable items beyond time tracking:
- **Fixed-Price Items**: One-time charges (setup fees, licenses, etc.)
- **Quantity-Based Items**: Items with variable quantities
- **Automatic Billing**: Integrates with invoice generation

## Tax Configuration System

### Tax Settings Overview

Service Vault includes a comprehensive tax management system that can be configured during setup or in settings:

**Setup Page Configuration** (Initial Installation):
- **Tax Enabled**: Enable/disable the tax system
- **Default Tax Rate**: System-wide tax percentage (e.g., 6%)
- **Tax Application Mode**: Controls which items are taxable
- **Time Entries Taxable by Default**: Whether time entries are taxable when application mode is "All Items"

**Tax Application Modes**:
1. **All Taxable Items**: Tax applies to both time entries (services) and addons (products)
2. **Products Only (No Services)**: Tax applies only to addons/products, not time entries
3. **Custom (Per Item)**: Tax application determined by individual line item settings

### Settings Page Tax Configuration

Navigate to **Settings > Billing > Tax Configuration** to modify tax settings:

**Available Settings**:
- **Enable Tax System**: Master toggle for tax calculations
- **Default Tax Rate**: Percentage applied to taxable items
- **Default Tax Application**: How taxes are applied system-wide
- **Time Entries Taxable by Default**: Controls default taxability for time entries

**Important**: Tax settings require clicking "Save Changes" - they are not auto-saved.

### Invoice Tax Behavior

**Tax Inheritance Hierarchy**:
1. **Invoice Override**: If enabled, invoice uses custom tax settings
2. **Account Settings**: Account-specific tax rates (future feature)
3. **System Defaults**: Global settings from configuration

**Per-Line-Item Tax Control**:
Each invoice line item has a taxable setting with three states:
- ‚úÖ **Taxable** (green): Item is explicitly taxable
- ‚ùå **Not Taxable** (red): Item is explicitly not taxable  
- ‚ûñ **Inherit** (gray): Item follows system/invoice settings

**Tax Calculation**:
- Tax is calculated individually per line item
- Final invoice shows subtotal, tax amount, and total
- Tax amount displays for each taxable line item in detail view

## Billing System

### Billing Rate Management

Service Vault uses a **simplified two-tier billing rate system**:

1. **Account-Specific Rates**: Custom rates for individual accounts
2. **Global Default Rates**: System-wide fallback rates

**Rate Priority**: Account-specific rates override global default rates.

**Recent Change**: Currency specification removed - all rates are in the system's base currency.

### Managing Billing Rates

**Settings ‚Üí Billing Rates**:
- **Create Global Rates**: Available to all accounts
- **Account-Specific Rates**: Override global rates for specific clients
- **Default Rates**: Mark rates as default for automatic selection
- **Rate Templates**: Save commonly used rate configurations

**Visual Indicators**:
- üîµ Blue badges: Account-specific rates
- üü¢ Green badges: Global default rates

### Time Tracking & Billing

**Automatic Billing Rate Application**:
1. Start timer on ticket ‚Üí Rate auto-selected based on:
   - Account-specific rate (if configured)
   - Global default rate (fallback)
   - Manual rate selection (override)

2. Stop timer ‚Üí Converts to time entry with calculated cost
3. Time entry ‚Üí Included in invoice generation

**Billing Calculation**:
```
Duration √ó Hourly Rate = Billable Amount
```

**Approval Workflow**:
- Time entries require manager approval for billing
- Approved entries included in invoicing
- Rejected entries excluded from billing

### Invoice Generation & Approval Workflow

  - üö´ Red rejected: Previously rejected items (excluded)
- **Smart Selection**: Only approved items can be invoiced
