# Service Vault Documentation

B2B **ticketing and time management platform** built with Laravel 12. Features role-based permissions, real-time messaging, and service ticket workflows.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Installation
composer install --optimize-autoloader
npm install
cp .env.example .env && php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Development
php artisan serve    # Laravel server (localhost:8000)
npm run dev         # Vite dev server with HMR
```

**Important**: Never automatically start development servers - users start them manually when needed.
