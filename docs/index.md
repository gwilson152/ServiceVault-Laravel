## Dashboard Architecture

### Widget-Based System

The dashboard uses a comprehensive widget system with:

- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically scans for widget components
- **Permission-Based Filtering**: Widgets only show for users with required permissions
- **Context Awareness**: Widgets adapt to service provider vs. account user contexts
- **Real-Time Data**: Widgets refresh automatically with live data

### Available Widgets

**Administration Widgets:**
- SystemHealthWidget - System status monitoring
- SystemStatsWidget - User, account, timer statistics  
- UserManagementWidget - User administration with account/role management
- AccountManagementWidget - Business customer account management
- AllTimersWidget - Admin monitoring of all active timers (Admin only)

**Service Delivery Widgets:**
- TicketOverviewWidget - Service tickets across accounts
- MyTicketsWidget - Assigned tickets for current user

**Time Management Widgets:**
- TimeTrackingWidget - Active timer management
- TimeEntriesWidget - Recent time entries and approvals

**Productivity Widgets:**
- QuickActionsWidget - Common actions based on role

### Permission-Based Visibility

Widgets are filtered based on user permissions:
```php
// Example widget permissions
'permissions' => ['admin.read', 'super_admin'],  // Admin only
'permissions' => ['tickets.view.assigned'],      // Basic ticket access
'permissions' => [],                             // Always available
```

## Timer System Architecture

### Multi-Timer Support

Service Vault supports multiple concurrent timers per user:

- **Concurrent Timers**: Users can run multiple timers simultaneously
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Redis-based state synchronization
- **Permission-Based Visibility**: Different timer interfaces based on user permissions
- **Admin Oversight**: Administrators can monitor and control all user timers

### Timer Components

**MultiTimerFAB** (Advanced Users):
- Multiple concurrent timer management
- Admin overlay showing all active timers
- Real-time admin controls for any user's timer
- Expandable interface with detailed timer information

**SimpleTimerFAB** (Basic Users):
- Single timer interface
- Basic start/stop/pause functionality
- Timer description editing
- Commit to time entry

**TicketTimerControls** (Ticket Integration):
- Inline timer controls per service ticket
- Dynamic button states based on user's timer status
- Support for multiple users working on same ticket
- Integration with CommitTimeEntryDialog

### Permission Structure

**Basic Timer Permissions**:
- `time.track` - Can track time
- `timers.create` - Can create timers
- `timers.manage.own` - Can manage own timers

**Advanced Timer Permissions**:
- `admin.read` - Can view admin features
- `timers.view.all` - Can see all timers
- `timers.manage.team` - Can manage team timers
- `managers.oversight` - Manager oversight capabilities

## Authentication System

### Hybrid Authentication

Service Vault implements a hybrid authentication system:

- **Session Authentication** (Laravel Breeze): Web dashboard with session cookies
- **Token Authentication** (Laravel Sanctum): API access with bearer tokens
- **Granular Abilities**: 23+ token abilities for specific functionality
- **Predefined Scopes**: Ready-to-use token scopes (employee, manager, mobile-app, admin)

### Token Management

```bash
# Create scoped tokens for different use cases
POST /api/auth/tokens/scope
{
    "scope": "employee",  // employee, manager, mobile-app, admin
    "name": "Mobile App Token"
}
```
