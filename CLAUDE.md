This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Service Vault is a comprehensive B2B service ticket and time management platform built with Laravel 12. It is primarily a **ticketing/service request platform** with sophisticated time tracking capabilities, featuring three-dimensional permission system (functional + widget + page access), and enterprise-level customization for multi-tenant service delivery.

### Current Status: Production-Ready Platform
**âœ… Core Platform Features:**
- **Three-Dimensional Permission System**: Functional + Widget + Page access control with role template management
- **Multi-Timer System**: Concurrent timers with Redis state management and real-time sync
- **Unified Selector System**: Consistent selector components for tickets, accounts, users, agents, and billing rates
- **StackedDialog Architecture**: Native dialog-based modal system with proper stacking and z-index management
- **Complete Billing System**: Two-tier billing rate hierarchy (Account-specific â†’ Global) with unified management
- **Feature-Specific Agent Permissions**: Granular agent assignment control for timers, tickets, time entries, and billing
- **Real-Time Broadcasting**: Laravel Reverb WebSocket server with instant ticket messaging and timer synchronization
- **TanStack Query Integration**: Optimized data fetching, caching, and error handling
- **Comprehensive API**: RESTful endpoints with bulk operations and three-dimensional authentication
- **Enterprise Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum hybrid session/token auth with granular abilities

**ðŸŽ¯ Platform Status:** Production-Ready

**Recent Key Improvements:**
- **Enhanced Time Entry Management**: Fixed critical duration calculation bugs, implemented automatic billing rate selection (account default â†’ global default), and made ticket selection optional for flexible time tracking
- **Improved API Consistency**: Standardized parameter naming from `assigned_user_id` to `agent_id` across ticket assignment APIs for better clarity and database schema alignment
- **Fixed Database Query Issues**: Resolved billing rates table column errors and UnifiedSelector initialization problems that were causing 500 errors on time entries page
- **Optimized UnifiedSelector Architecture**: Fixed component initialization order issues and improved error handling for smoother UI interactions across all selector components
- **Complete Billing Page with Approval Workflow**: Enhanced invoice generation with integrated approval workflow, visual status indicators, and bulk operations for time entries and ticket addons
- **Advanced Approval System**: Step-through approval wizard accessible from billing page and time entries, with individual/bulk approval capabilities and progress tracking
- **Smart Invoice Creation**: Account-based item discovery with automatic approval status filtering, real-time totals, and visual indicators for pending vs approved items
- **TanStack Query Integration**: Complete migration from direct fetch calls to TanStack Query for billing operations with automatic cache invalidation and error handling
- **Timer Commit System**: Fixed timer commit workflow - timers now properly update to "committed" status in database with time_entry_id linkage, persistent across page refreshes
- **Standardized Duration Handling**: Corrected duration calculations throughout the system - consistent minutes-based storage with proper validation and display formatting
- **Simplified Timer UX**: Removed unnecessary "Override timer duration" checkbox - duration fields now pre-fill directly from timer data and are immediately editable
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added robust error handling to TimerBroadcastOverlay formatDuration function to prevent Vue component crashes
- **Enhanced Edit Ticket Dialog Preselection**: Edit ticket dialog now properly preselects account, customer, and agent with visual context indicators and activeSelection support
- **Enhanced Time Entry Creation from Tickets**: Time entry creation from `/tickets/id` page now automatically preselects account, ticket, and proper billing rate hierarchy (account default â†’ global default)
- **Fixed Selector Dropdown Issues**: Resolved issue where searched selectors wouldn't close after item selection, improving user experience across all selector components
- **Enhanced Unified Selector System**: Self-managing selectors with automatic data loading, debounced case-insensitive search, recent items tracking, focus preservation, and proper dropdown dismissal
- **Enhanced Billing Rate System**: Complete overhaul of billing rate selection and display across timer creation, editing, and commit workflows
- **Timer Billing Rate Preservation**: Timer commit now preserves original billing rates even when accounts have overriding rates with same names
- **Improved Rate Auto-Selection**: Both timer creation and time entry dialogs properly auto-select account default â†’ global default rates
- **Enhanced Rate Display**: Billing rates now show "Description â€¢ $XX.XX/hr" format with clear disambiguation between account and global rates
- **Timer System Fixes**: Fixed timer creation and editing issues - ticket_id and account_id now save properly, edit modal displays pre-selected values correctly
- **Currency System Removal**: Removed all currency specifications from billing rates system for simplified pricing structure
- **Migration System Stability**: Fixed duplicate migration errors and improved migration resilience with existence checks
- **Admin Dashboard Enhancement**: Fixed recentActivity data structure to display system activities properly in chronological order
- **Timer Performance Optimization**: Eliminated N+1 query problem in tickets list by embedding user-specific timer data in ticket API responses
- **Account Hierarchy Removal**: Simplified account structure by removing complex hierarchy system while maintaining core functionality
- **Setup Page Streamlining**: Updated setup wizard to remove account hierarchy configuration for cleaner initial setup experience
- **StackedDialog Architecture**: All modals converted to use native dialog with proper stacking and z-index management
- **Streamlined Ticket Creation**: Merged basic info and assignment tabs for improved user experience
- **Enhanced Modal System**: Vertical expansion to fit content, proper modal stacking, and consistent UI
- **Real-Time Ticket Messaging**: Live comments with Laravel Reverb WebSocket broadcasting and permission-based filtering
- **Enhanced Role Management**: Comprehensive permission descriptions, tooltips, notation guides, and improved layout with summary panel
- **Left-Aligned Timer Interface**: Timer overlay and individual timers now align left with improved visual hierarchy
- **Fixed Ticket Addon System**: Resolved UUID generation issues and standardized billable column usage across all models
- **Unified Ticket Edit Dialog**: Ticket detail page uses the same CreateTicketModalTabbed component for editing, providing consistent UI/UX with smart data prefilling
