# FreeScout API Import System Implementation

## Project Overview
Create a comprehensive FreeScout API import system that allows users to import conversations, customers, and mailboxes from FreeScout instances via REST API.

## Phase 1: UI Scaffolding with Mock Data ✅ COMPLETED

### Core Components
- [x] **Main Page**: `resources/js/Pages/Import/FreescoutApi.vue`
  - Profile management interface with API profile cards
  - Import configuration panel integration
  - Preview and execution controls
  - Progress tracking display with statistics sidebar

- [x] **API Profile Modal**: `resources/js/Pages/Import/Components/FreescoutApiProfileModal.vue`
  - FreeScout instance URL configuration
  - API key authentication with masked input
  - Connection testing with mock responses
  - Profile save/edit functionality
  - Advanced settings (timeout, rate limiting, SSL verification)

- [x] **Import Config Panel**: `resources/js/Pages/Import/Components/FreescoutImportConfigPanel.vue`
  - Import limits (conversations, customers, mailboxes) with availability preview
  - Account mapping strategy selection:
    - Map mailboxes to accounts with visual preview
    - Skip account import and use domain mapping
  - Unmapped user handling options (auto-create, skip, default account)
  - Date range filtering with checkbox toggle
  - Real-time import summary with estimated counts

### Navigation & Routing
- [x] Add route `/import/freescout-api` in `routes/web.php`
- [x] Add navigation link from main import page (`/import`) with feature cards

### Mock Data Structures
- [x] API profiles with connection status (connected, testing, error, pending)
- [x] Realistic FreeScout data with detailed conversation threads, customer info, and mailbox descriptions
- [x] Import configuration presets and validation with live preview
- [x] Progress tracking mock states with recent activity feed and real-time updates

### Enhanced UI Features
- [x] **Import Preview Dialog**: Comprehensive data preview with tabbed interface showing sample conversations, customers, mailboxes, and time entries
- [x] **Import Execution Dialog**: Real-time progress tracking with section-by-section progress bars, activity logs, and error handling
- [x] **Connection Testing**: Animated connection testing with loading states and automatic stats refresh
- [x] **Responsive Design**: Proper AppLayout integration with navigation menu and mobile-responsive layout
- [x] **Live Activity Feed**: Real-time activity updates showing import progress and connection test results
- [x] **Mailbox Exclusion System**: Visual interface to exclude specific mailboxes from import with inverted logic (all included by default)
- [x] **Time Entries Support**: Full integration of FreeScout time entries with duration tracking and billable status

### Advanced Sync & Duplicate Detection
- [x] **Sync Strategy Configuration**: Three modes for handling existing records
  - Create Only: Skip existing records, create new ones only (safest for initial imports)
  - Update Only: Skip new records, update existing ones only (for syncing changes)
  - Upsert: Create new records if they don't exist, update if they do (best for ongoing sync)
- [x] **Comprehensive Duplicate Detection**: Three detection methods
  - External ID Matching: Track records using FreeScout IDs (most reliable)
  - Content Matching: Match by email/subject/agent combinations
  - Fuzzy Matching: Advanced similarity algorithms for edge cases
- [x] **External ID Storage**: Automatic tracking of FreeScout IDs in Service Vault fields
  - Conversations → `tickets.external_id`
  - Customers → `users.external_id`  
  - Time Entries → `time_entries.external_id`
  - Accounts → `accounts.external_id`
- [x] **Import Run Tracking**: Optional audit trail with timestamps, counts, and duplicate statistics
- [x] **Automated Scheduling**: Configurable sync frequency (hourly, daily, weekly, manual)
- [x] **Duplicate Estimation**: Real-time preview of estimated duplicates based on detection method

## Phase 2: Backend Implementation (Ready for Development)

### ✅ API Research Completed
- **Time Entries Confirmed**: `/api/conversations/{id}/timelogs` endpoint with `timeSpent`, `paused`, `finished` fields
- **Authentication**: X-FreeScout-API-Key header method validated
- **Pagination**: Default 50 items per page, supports `page` and `pageSize` parameters
- **Date Filtering**: `createdSince` and `updatedSince` parameters for incremental sync
- **No Rate Limits**: No explicit rate limiting mentioned in documentation
- **No Bulk Endpoints**: Individual record creation only - external ID tracking essential

### ⚠️ Critical Sync Challenge Identified
**Problem**: Time entries are nested under conversations (`/api/conversations/{id}/timelogs`). If someone adds a time entry to an old conversation, incremental sync using `?updatedSince` may miss it since the conversation's `updatedAt` timestamp might be older than the last sync date.

**Solution**: Implemented hybrid sync strategy with three modes:
- **Incremental Only**: Fast `?updatedSince` sync (may miss some time entries)
- **Full Scan**: Check ALL conversations for time entries (thorough but slower)  
- **Hybrid (Recommended)**: Daily incremental + periodic full scan for optimal balance

### API Integration
- [ ] FreeScout REST API client with X-FreeScout-API-Key authentication
- [ ] Pagination handling (default 50 items per page)
- [ ] Error handling for unique constraint violations
- [ ] Time entries import via `/api/conversations/{id}/timelogs`

### Data Processing  
- [ ] Conversation import with time entries linking
- [ ] Customer import and deduplication via email matching
- [ ] Mailbox to account mapping with exclusion logic
- [ ] Domain-based user matching integration
- [ ] Progress tracking with WebSocket events for paginated imports

### Database Schema
- [ ] FreeScout API profile storage (validated fields)
- [ ] Import job tracking with time entries support
- [ ] External ID mappings (critical for duplicate prevention)
- [ ] Audit trail integration with sync strategy tracking

## User Experience Requirements

### Import Configuration Options
1. **Import Limits**: User-configurable limits for each data type
2. **Account Mapping Strategy**:
   - **Option A**: Map FreeScout mailboxes to Service Vault accounts
   - **Option B**: Skip account import, use existing domain mapping settings
3. **Unmapped User Handling**: Auto-create accounts for users without domain mappings

### UI/UX Standards
- Follow existing import system patterns
- Use StandardPageLayout for consistent experience
- Implement StackedDialog architecture for modals
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Real-time progress tracking during imports

## Technical Notes

### API Endpoints (FreeScout)
- **Authentication**: API Key in Authorization header
- **Base URL**: `{instance_url}/api/`
- **Key Endpoints**:
  - `GET /conversations` - List conversations with pagination
  - `GET /customers` - List customers with search
  - `GET /mailboxes` - List mailboxes with details
  - `GET /users` - List users and agents

### Integration Points
- Leverage existing domain mapping system
- Use unified import preview architecture
- Integrate with WebSocket progress tracking
- Follow three-dimensional permission model
