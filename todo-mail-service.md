## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

### High Risk
- **Email Delivery Reliability**: Implement retry logic and multiple driver fallback
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Comprehensive input validation and permission checks
- **Performance Impact**: Queue-based processing to prevent blocking

### Medium Risk
- **Domain Mapping Complexity**: Leverage existing robust system
- **Command Parsing Errors**: Extensive validation and error handling
- **Integration Issues**: Incremental testing at each phase

### Low Risk
- **UI/UX Complexity**: Follow existing ServiceVault design patterns
- **Configuration Management**: Build on established settings system

---

## 📝 Technical Decisions

### Email Driver Priority
1. **SMTP** - Most compatible, reliable
2. **SES** - AWS integration for scalability
3. **Postmark** - Excellent deliverability
4. **Log** - Development/testing

### Command Syntax Choice
- **Format**: `command:value` (simple, readable)
- **Separator**: Colon for clarity
- **Case**: Insensitive for user-friendliness
- **Multiple**: Space-separated in subject line

### Queue Strategy
- **Driver**: Database (consistent with existing setup)
- **Retry Policy**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds per job
- **Batching**: Supported for bulk operations
