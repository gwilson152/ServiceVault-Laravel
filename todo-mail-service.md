## 📝 Technical Decisions

### Email Driver Priority
1. **SMTP** - Most compatible, reliable
2. **SES** - AWS integration for scalability
3. **Postmark** - Excellent deliverability
4. **Log** - Development/testing

### Command Syntax Choice
- **Format**: `command:value` (simple, readable)
- **Separator**: Colon for clarity
- **Case**: Insensitive for user-friendliness
- **Multiple**: Space-separated in subject line

### Queue Strategy
